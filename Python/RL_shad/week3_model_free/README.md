### Assignments

This week's practice will require you to pick __one of__ `./seminar_main` and `./seminar_alternative` as first part.

Then `./homework` and follow instructions in `./homework/homework.ipynb`

Below are some guidelines on what to do in seminar_main/_alternative.

### ./seminar_main
_this assignment borrows code from awesome [cs188](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)_
This homework assignment works on __python2 only__. If you stick to py3, consider seminar_alternative. Or just install it for this homework alone and remove afterwards.

This homework also requires some physical display (e.g. laptop monitor). It won't work on binder VM / headless server. Please run it on laptop or consider ./seminar_alternative


* You need to implement **QLearining** algorithm.  If you're running go to ```seminar_main/``` folder and open file ```qlearningAgent.py```.

Once you're done, run use those commands:
```
python crawler.py # Crawler with qlearning
python pacman.py -p <your agent> -x <number of train samples> -n <total number of samples> -l <grid env>
python pacman.py -p PacmanQAgent -x 5000 -n 5010 -l smallGrid # example
```
* Make sure you can tune agent to beat ./run_crawler.sh
 * on windows, just run `python crawler.py` from cmd in the project directory
* other ./run* files are mostly for your amusement. 
  * ./run_pacman.sh will need more epochs to converge, see [comments](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/blob/master/week3/seminar_main/run_pacman.sh)
  * on windows, just copy the type `python pacman.py -p PacmanQAgent -x 2000 -n 2010 -l smallGrid` in cmd from assignemnt dir
(YSDA/HSE) Please submit only qlearningAgents.py file and include a brief text report as comments in it.

### ./seminar_alternative

You'll have to implement qlearning.py just like in main seminar, but in ./seminar_alternative folder. After you're done with it, open the seminar notebook and follow instructions from there.
