### Assignment
From now on, we'll have two tracks: theano and tensorflow. We'll also add pytorch seminars as soon as they're ready.

Your assignment is in either semianr_theano.ipynb or seminar_tensorflow.ipynb.

#### What to choose?
* If you're familiar with numpy but not with symbolic graphs, theano is easier to dive in and better suited for jupyter notebooks.
* If you want to be familiar with sessions, scopes and similar tools from day 1, choose TensorFlow. It's much more convenient to deploy (to non-python or to mobiles).
* Out in the internet, radical theano fans say TF is rubbish and radical TF fans say theano is dead. Both are wrong.
* It's not like choosing house at Hogwarts, you'll be able to switch between frameworks easily once you master the underlying principles.
